URL Shortener Application

Sometimes we need to share or send links and this can be annoying to copy and paste long URLs. That is where URL shorteners come in. URL shorteners make it easy to share links by shortening them.

The project consists of 2 parts:
1. Frontend (done with HTML, CSS)
2. Backend - Flask (Python)
3. Backend - Database ORM

Front-End Information
 The front end consists of 2 web pages:
1. Home Page - A page will be shown where the user can enter the URL he/she wants to shorten. After the ‘shorten’ button is clicked, the shortened URL is displayed in the text field which the user can copy and use the shorten Url.
2. History Page - Containing all the Original URLs along with the Shortened URLs.

Project Workflow
1. Users can enter the URL they want to shorten. After entering a URL, click on the ‘Shorten’ URL button to display the shortened URL in the following text field.
2. After the ‘Shorten’ button is clicked, the URL that is entered is saved in our database with the shortened URL. It is saved in the database so that the user can look into the previous URLs he/she entered in our web app with their shortened URL.
